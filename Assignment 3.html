          <h2>Chicken</h2>
             He prepared his ingredients carefully. Any mistakes now would not bode well. Who could be judging his culinary skills this closely, especially this late in the evening in this busy kitchen? And at this particular moment, just after he pulled off the big surprise with his signature chicken dish. Was there another chef who had the same idea, now watching him and waiting to critique his methods? Or did the faint aroma behind him mean that one of the many food critics in town was onto him, just waiting to pounce and deliver a scathing review? He nervously glanced around. Suddenly, he saw the recipe book. Like lightning, he flipped it open and disappeared into the pages, almost knocking over the jar of spices lying in the middle of the counter. He tried to carefully measure out the ingredients in the dim kitchen light and suddenly stiffened: it was a challenging recipe, he would have to go back and check his steps. The kitchen noises got louder and louder, he saw the steam rising from the pot on the stove. Is this the end of the line? he thought, pressing himself back against the counter, trying to remember every detail. He was dripping with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the garlic and herbs clinging to his apron. Suddenly, next to him, with a barely noticeable rustle, a page in the recipe book swung quietly to and fro in the kitchen’s breeze. Could this be the breakthrough he’d prayed for? Slowly, he slid toward the book, pressing himself more and more into the task at hand, away from his fears. Would this recipe save his reputation?
